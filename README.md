# shopbot

shopping list discord bot

## Purpose

The Alex and Google Home smart speakers are annoying, they don't allow you to remove an item from a shopping list and they don't check for duplicates.  They are slow to produce a full list when asked.  This project replaces that functionality with a discord bot.  The future is now.

## Pre Requisites

* For windows, Python <https://www.python.org/downloads/>
* For linux, you should already have python installed. If not try:

```bash
apt-get install python3
apt-get install python3-pip
```

## Usage

```bash
# pip install discord.py==0.16.12
# git clone https://github.com/juanino/shopbot.git
# cp shopbotconfig_example.py shopbotconfig.py
# ./shopBot.py
```
