shopping list discord bot

# Purpose
The Alex and Google Home smart speakers are annoying, they don't allow you to remove an item from a shopping list and they don't check for duplicates.  They are slow to produce a full list when asked.  This project replaces that functionality with a discord bot.  The future is now.
